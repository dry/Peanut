summary:
h2. Configuration 

Peanut is a zero-configuration application - it will work just by uploading the files to your webserver. However, you can easily modify Peanut's configuration to suit your installation or page requirements.

h2. Configuration Options 

The index.php contains a config array. This is where you can specify your installation-specific options. The default array looks like this:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/942570.js"> </script>

You can modify these options and add others if required. They are explained below:

h3. system_folder

The name of the main folder containing the Peanut files. If you change this don't forget to rename the folder appropriately.

h3. default_layout

Peanut uses the concept of "layouts":/documentation/layouts.txt to define how your pages should be displayed. There must be at least one layout and a simple one called main.html is in your layouts folder (by default at peanut/layouts/main.html).

h3. text_parser

All page custom fields except the title are run through a text parser. "Textile":http://www.textism.com/tools/textile is provided and is the default though you can use another one if it is available. The text parsers are Peanut "plugins":/documentation/plugins.txt.

h2. Additional Options

There are a number of other options that can be set if required.

h3(#file_extension). file_extension

By default all individual pages will be suffixed by .html for browser requests. You can change this to whatever you wish. Just make sure to include the dot with the extension. Don't forget that all pages should be saved with a .txt extension. The extension shown when browsing is dynamic dependent upon this setting.

h3. left_delim/right_delim

You can modify the variable delimiters used in "layouts":/documentation/layouts.txt if required. By default they are set to { and }.
