summary:
h2. Configuration 

Peanut is a zero-configuration application - it will work just by uploading the files to your webserver. However, you can easily modify Peanut's configuration to suit your installation or page requirements.

body:
h2. Configuration Options 

The index.php contains a config array. This is where you can specify your installation-specific options. The default array looks like this:

bc. $config = array(
	'system_folder' => 'peanut',
	'default_layout' => 'main.html',
	'text_parser' => 'textile'
);

You can modify these options and add others if required. They are explained below:

h3. system_folder

The name of the main folder containing the Peanut files. If you change this don't forget to rename the folder appropriately.

h3. default_layout

Peanut uses the concept of "layouts":/documentation/layouts.txt to define how your pages should be displayed. There must be at least one layout and a simple one called main.html is in your layouts folder (by default at peanut/layouts/main.html).
