h2. Detailed Instructions 

"Download":http://code.purple-dogfish.co.uk/peanut/get/tip.zip the Peanut software and unzip it. You should see one file and two folders:

* peanut folder
* assets folder
* index.php file

There is also an .htaccess file that in most cases won't be visible. When you copy the files from this folder to your webserver make sure to use a program that allows you to see and copy hidden files.

Copy these files and folders to your webserver where you want Peanut-managed pages to appear. This does not have to be your site root.
