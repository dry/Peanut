summary:
h2. What is it?

Peanut is a lightweight file-based content management system. It is ideal for brochure-style sites or application documentation. It has no dependencies and very few requirements:

* PHP 5
* A server rewriting module

There is no web-based login system or account management, pages are created as text files and immediately become live on your site.
